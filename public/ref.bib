However, recent research suggests that the conventional wisdom is wrong. Avoidance and fear are conflated, and there is no compelling evidence to support fear of heights in human infants. Infants avoid crawling or walking over an impossibly high drop-off because they perceive affordances for locomotion---the relations between their own bodies and skills and the relevant properties of the environment that make an action such as descent possible or impossible.},

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

Schizoanalysis holds that art's function is both political and aesthetic - it changes perception. If one cannot change perception, then, one cannot change anything politically. This is why Deleuze and Guattari always insist that the artists operate at the level of the real (not the imaginary or the symbolic). Ultimately, they argue, there is no necessary distinction to be made between aesthetics and politics. One is simply the flipside of the other because both concern the formation and transformation of social and cultural norms. Deleuze and the Schizoanalysis of Visual Art explores how every artist, good or bad, contributes to the structure and nature of society because their work either reinforces social norms, or challenges them. On this view of things, we are all artists, we all have the potential to exercise what might be called a 'aesthetico-political function' and change the world around us; or, just as easily, we can dwell like assassins, and not only let the status quo endure but fight to preserve it as though it were freedom itself"--},

Drawing on startling new research in neuroscience, behavioural psychology and perception, he shows that we have no hidden depths to plumb \& unconscious thought is a myth. Instead, we generate our ideas, motives and thoughts in the moment. As the reader discovers, through mind-bending visual examples and counterintuitive experiments, we are all characters of our own creation, constantly improvising our behaviour based on our past experiences.

  abstract = {The Gollin test (measuring recognition thresholds for fragmented line drawings of everyday objects and animals) has traditionally been regarded as a test of incomplete figure perception or `closure', though there is a debate about how such closure is achieved. Here, figural incompleteness is considered to be the result of masking, such that absence of contour elements of a fragmented figure is the result of the influence of an `invisible' mask. It is as though the figure is partly obscured by a mask having parameters identical to those of the background. This mask is `invisible' only consciously, but for the early stages of visual processing it is real and has properties of multiplicative noise. Incomplete Gollin figures were modeled as the figure covered by the mask with randomly distributed transparent and opaque patches. We adjusted the statistical characteristics of the contour image and empty noise patches and processed those using spatial and spatial-frequency measures. Across 73 figures, despite inter-subject variability, mean recognition threshold was always approximately 15\% of total contour in naive observers. Recognition worsened with increasing spectral similarity between the figure and the `invisible' mask. Near threshold, the spectrum of the fragmented image was equally similar to that of the `invisible' mask and complete image. The correlation between spectral parameters of figures at threshold and complete figures was greatest for figures that were most easily recognised. Across test sessions, thresholds reduced when either figure or mask parameters were familiar. We argue that recognition thresholds for Gollin stimuli in part reflect the extraction of signal from noise.},

Here we conducted a version of a hue-cancelation experiment with the Tsimane' people, a non-industrialized culture in the Amazon. Tsimane' speakers readily identified reddish and greenish color chips, but they showed idiosyncratic choices when asked to identify a color that is neither reddish nor greenish, unlike English speakers who consistently select focal yellow. The Tsimane' participants who also spoke Spanish and had a consistent label for English ``yellow'' (``amarillo''), performed similarly to the Tsimane' monolinguals, suggesting that simply having a label for ``yellow'' is not sufficient to explain the consistency of English speakers. The results add to a growing body of evidence that does not support Opponent Colors Theory.},

Here, we provide evidence that the feature representations embedded in purely feed- forward neural networks are sufficient to explain seemingly high-level human judgments: in this case, the stability of randomly arranged block towers. To do this, we first show that we can linearly decode stability from the features of two deep neural networks -- a supervised network trained on ImageNet, and a varia- tional autoencoder trained only to reconstruct images of block towers from various perspectives -- neither of which were ever taught stability per se. We then derive a set of image-computable features to use as predictors of performance, finding that the stability judgments of both human subjects and the neural net decoders are best predicted by the same feature. Our findings suggest overall that at least some aspects of seemingly higher-level reasoning in a now paradigmatic intuitive physics task may be grounded in direct readouts of purely perceptual features.},

Originally seen as a manifestation of plasticity in the primary visual cortex, perceptual learning is more readily understood as improvements in the function of brain networks that integrate processes, including sensory representations, decision, attention, and reward, and balance plasticity with system stability. This review considers the primary phenomena of perceptual learning, theories of perceptual learning, and perceptual learning's effect on signal and noise in visual processing and decision. Models, especially computational models, play a key role in behavioral and physiological investigations of the mechanisms of perceptual learning and for understanding, predicting, and optimizing human perceptual processes, learning, and performance. Performance improvements resulting from reweighting or readout of sensory inputs to decision provide a strong theoretical framework for interpreting perceptual learning and transfer that may prove useful in optimizing learning in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Air Force pilots and control subjects were tested on a visual ``mental rotation'' task. Nine of the 16 pilots, as well as all of the 16 control subjects, required more time to rotate greater angular distances. The performance of the other 7 pilots was unique: their response time did not increase with greater angular rotations. The results suggest that visual mental rotation can be accomplished by at least two different processes. One process involves incremental object rotations in a multi-step mapping --like an actual physical rotation of an object-- going through intermediate stages. This process requires more time to rotate greater angular distances. The other process involves direct translation in a single-step mapping. In this process, the starting position transforms into the final position in one mapping without any intermediate steps, and thus does not require more time to rotate greater angular rotation. The lack of intermediate stages, which may allow small perturbations in location to be corrected, affects the accuracy of this process; this is particularly apparent when more complex stimuli are rotated. The pilots who did not show incremental rotation effects had different and distinct error patterns, their errors increased when rotating the more complex stimuli.},

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.},

  abstract = {We can quickly and effortlessly evaluate whether a tower of blocks will collapse or a stack of dishes will come crashing down. What is the nature of this ability? Although such "intuitive physics" are traditionally associated with higher-level reasoning, here we explore the possibility that such sophisticated physical intuitions are underwritten by more basic processes -- and specifically whether visual attention and memory are automatically drawn toward physically relevant features. In a modified change-detection task, an image of a physically stable block-tower was briefly displayed, after which it disappeared and was replaced either in the same configuration or with one block slightly displaced. On some trials, this change upset the tower's balance, rendering it unstable; on other trials, the change was identical in magnitude but did not alter the tower's stability. Detection was reliably better for changes to blocks that altered overall stability, compared to either (1) equivalent changes to the same blocks that did not influence stability, or (2) equivalent changes to different blocks. Critically, this pattern was robust even though stability was entirely incidental to the task. Follow-up studies demonstrated that improved change detection based on physical stability was reliable even when attending to physical stability could confer no strategic advantage, and was robust even for observers who never consciously noticed any variation in the towers' (in)stability. Further work isolated perceived stability, per se: when the towers' ground-truth stability (according to physics) was contrasted with subjectively perceived stability (as rated by independent subjects), change-detection was better predicted by how stable the towers *looked* than by how stable they actually were. Collectively, this work shows how basic processes of attention and memory are sensitive to a scene's underlying physics, and how selective attention is automatically drawn to those objects and features that are especially physically relevant.

The first of these functions is embodied in the `` Relative Visibility ''* curve of the spectrum, and the second is embodied in a curve showing the locus of the spectrum on the `` colour triangle '' of some trichromatic system. These two functions may be combined to give the `` mixture curves '' of the spectrum, by means of which we can calculate both the photometric and colorimetric values of any stimulus from its spectral energy distribution. The nature and significance of these various functions are sufficiently well understood to need no explanation here.},

Here, we used computational methods in combination with functional neuroimaging to provide evidence that the aesthetic value of a visual stimulus is computed in a hierarchical manner via a weighted integration over both low and high level stimulus features contained in early and late visual cortex, extending into parietal and lateral prefrontal cortices. Feature representations in parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex may in turn be utilized to produce an overall aesthetic value in the medial prefrontal cortex. Such brain-wide computations are not only consistent with a feature-based mechanism for value construction, but also resemble computations performed by a deep convolutional neural network. Our findings thus shed light on the existence of a general neurocomputational mechanism for rapidly and flexibly producing value judgements across an array of complex novel stimuli and situations.},

Drawing on recent work on culture and cognition, the authors predicted that people with European-American cultural backgrounds would be more capable of using part cues in perceptual inference than those with Asian backgrounds. No such cross-cultural difference was expected for the ability to use holistic cues. In two studies, participants were presented with either one of the two types of cues and asked to infer the identity of the original objects. As predicted, in the part-cue condition European-American participants performed better than did Japanese (Study 1) and Asian-American participants (Study 2). Also as predicted, there was no cultural difference in the holistic-cue condition. The results were interpreted with reference to other related studies documenting reliable cross-cultural differences in cognition.},

Typical images are highly complex because they consist of many objects embedded in background clutter. Moreover, the image features of an object are extremely variable and ambiguous owing to the effects of projection, occlusion, background clutter, and illumination. The very success of everyday vision implies neural mechanisms, yet to be understood, that discount irrelevant information and organize ambiguous or noisy local image features into objects and surfaces. Recent work in Bayesian theories of visual perception has shown how complexity may be managed and ambiguity resolved through the task-dependent, probabilistic integration of prior object knowledge with image features.},

  abstract = {When viewing a painting, artists perceive more information from the painting on the basis of their experience and knowledge than art novices do. This difference can be reflected in eye scan paths during viewing of paintings. Distributions of scan paths of artists are different from those of novices even when the paintings contain no figurative object (i.e. abstract paintings). There are two possible explanations for this difference of scan paths. One is that artists have high sensitivity to high-level features such as textures and composition of colors and therefore their fixations are more driven by such features compared with novices. The other is that fixations of artists are more attracted by salient features than those of novices and the fixations are driven by low-level features. To test these, we measured eye fixations of artists and novices during the free viewing of various abstract paintings and compared the distribution of their fixations for each painting with a topological attentional map that quantifies the conspicuity of low-level features in the painting (i.e. saliency map). We found that the fixation distribution of artists was more distinguishable from the saliency map than that of novices. This difference indicates that fixations of artists are less driven by low-level features than those of novices. Our result suggests that artists may extract visual information from paintings based on high-level features. This ability of artists may be associated with artists' deep aesthetic appreciation of paintings.},

  abstract = {The studies described here use functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether common or distinct cognitive and/or neural mechanisms are involved in extracting object structure from the different image cues defining an object's shape, such as contours, shading, and monocular depth cues. We found overlapping activations in the lateral and ventral occipital cortex [known as the lateral occipital complex (LOC)] for objects defined by different visual cues (e.g., grayscale photographs and line drawings) when each was compared with its own scrambled-object control. In a second experiment we found a reduced response when objects were repeated, independent of whether they appeared in the same or a different format (i.e., grayscale images vs line drawings). A third experiment showed that activation in the LOC was no stronger for three-dimensional shapes defined by contours or monocular depth cues, such as occlusion, than for two-dimensional shapes, suggesting that these regions are not selectively involved in processing three-dimensional shape information. These results suggest that common regions in the LOC are involved in extracting and/or representing information about object structure from different image cues.},

  abstract = {The evolution of ideas about the way we see color was closely linked to physical theories of light. Proponents of both corpuscular and wave theories viewed light as a continuous spectrum. This was not easily reconciled with the fact that, for the human eye, all colors can be matched by mixture of three primaries. Physicists such as Mayer who described trichromatic color matching often assumed that there were just three types of rays in the spectrum. This argument was finally resolved by Thomas Young, who noted that trichromatic color matching was consistent with a continuous spectrum if there were just three receptors in the eye. This kind of conceptual mistake, in this case the confusion of the properties of the visual system with physical properties of light, has been common in the history of color science. As another example, the idea of trichromacy was disputed by those who viewed color sensations as opponent processes, red-green, blue-yellow and black-white. The discovery of color-opponent neurons in the visual pathway has partly resolved this dilemma. Much of the physiological substrate of the way we detect and distinguish colors is now established, but the link between the signals leaving the retina and the way we name and order colors is still poorly defined.},

  abstract = {An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the               primal sketch               . For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define ` placetokens' in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that `non-attentive' vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally               precede               the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down.},

  abstract = {The human visual process can be studied by examining the computational problems associated with deriving useful information from retinal images. In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria,               accessibility, scope and uniqueness               , and               stability and sensitivity               , are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation's design are considered, (i) the representation's coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape's natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described.},

There have, however, been several other developments of this concept, chiefly by Gwilym Grindley and Edward Calvert. Based on rarely referenced scientific literature and archival research, this article describes the development of the concept of optic flow by the aforementioned authors and several others. The article furthermore presents the available evidence for interactions between these authors, focusing on whether parts of Gibson's proposal were derived from the work of Grindley or Calvert. While Grindley's work may have made Gibson aware of the geometrical facts of optic flow, Gibson's work is not derivative of Grindley's. It is furthermore shown that Gibson only learned of Calvert's work in 1956, almost a decade after Gibson first published his proposal. In conclusion, the development of the concept of optic flow presents an intriguing example of convergent thought in the progress of science.},

Initial empirical findings spurred a debate about the heterogeneity of mental representation: Is all information stored in propositional, language-like, symbolic internal representations, or can humans use at least two different types of representations (and possibly many more)? Here, in historical context, we describe recent evidence that humans do not always rely on propositional internal representations but, instead, can also rely on at least one other format: depictive representation. We propose that the debate should now move on to characterizing all of the different forms of human mental representation.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that there is something special about reasoning by using mental images. The question of how it is special, however, has never been satisfactorily spelled out, despite more than thirty years of research in the post-behaviorist tradition. This article considers some of the general motivation for the assumption that entertaining mental images involves inspecting a picture-like object. It sets out a distinction between phenomena attributable to the nature of mind to what is called the cognitive architecture, and ones that are attributable to tacit knowledge used to simulate what would happen in a visual situation. With this distinction in mind, the paper then considers in detail the widely held assumption that in some important sense images are               spatially displayed               or are               depictive,               and that examining images uses the same mechanisms that are deployed in visual perception. I argue that the assumption of the spatial or depictive nature of images is only explanatory if taken literally, as a claim about how images are physically instantiated in the brain, and that the literal view fails for a number of empirical reasons -- for example, because of the cognitive penetrability of the phenomena cited in its favor. Similarly, while it is arguably the case that imagery and vision involve some of the same mechanisms, this tells us very little about the nature of mental imagery and does not support claims about the pictorial nature of mental images. Finally, I consider whether recent neuroscience evidence clarifies the debate over the nature of mental images. I claim that when such questions as whether images are depictive or spatial are formulated more clearly, the evidence does not provide support for the picture-theory over a symbol-structure theory of mental imagery. Even if all the empirical claims were true, they do not warrant the conclusion that many people have drawn from them: that mental images are depictive or are displayed in some (possibly cortical) space. Such a conclusion is incompatible with what is known about how images function in thought. We are then left with the provisional counterintuitive conclusion that the available evidence does not support rejection of what I call the ``null hypothesis''; namely, that reasoning with mental images involves the same form of representation and the same processes as that of reasoning in general, except that the content or subject matter of thoughts experienced as images includes information about how things would look.},

  abstract = {An important scientific debate took place regarding falling bodies hundreds of years ago, and it still warrants introspection. Galileo argued that in a vacuum all bodies fall at the same rate relative to the earth, independent of their mass. Aristotle seemed to consider all media to be viscous, and argued that heavier bodies fall faster. Aristotle was challenged by Philoponus, who argued that light and heavy weights fall about equally fast in air, eleven hundred years before Galileo. As we shall see, the problem is more subtle than meets the eye -- even in a frictionless medium. Philoponus and Galileo are right part of the time, and Aristotle is partly right some of the time. In fact they are all wrong the rest of the time, with the lightest body falling fastest when two bodies fall toward the earth. In principle the results of a free fall experiment depend on whether falling masses originate on earth, are extraterrestrial, are sequential or concurrent, or are simultaneous for coincident or separated bodies, etc. When single falling bodies originate from the earth, all bodies (light and heavy) fall at the same rate relative to the earth in agreement with Galileo's view. Einstein's General Relativity (EGR), in which gravity is due to space-time curvature, was motivated by the Galilean notion that free-fall is independent of the mass and properties of a falling body, and is just due to the properties of the milieu it finds itself in. Quantum mechanics is found to violate the Equivalence Principle of EGR.},

The computational properties of this ``two-systems'' design were explored by constructing simplifying connectionist models. The models were designed to simultaneously classify and locate shapes that could appear in multiple positions in a matrix, and the ease of forming representations of the two kinds of information was measured. Some networks were designed so that all hidden nodes projected to all output nodes, whereas others had the hidden nodes split into two groups, with some projecting to the output nodes that registered shape identity and the remainder projecting to the output nodes that registered location. The simulations revealed that splitting processing into separate streams for identifying and locating a shape led to better performance only under some circumstances. Provided that enough computational resources were available in both streams, split networks were able to develop more efficient internal representations, as revealed by detailed analyses of the patterns of weights between connections.},

  abstract = {With each eye fixation, we experience a richly detailed visual world. Yet recent work on visual integration and change direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the details of our environment from one view to the next: we often do not detect large changes to objects and scenes (`change blindness'). Furthermore, without attention, we may not even perceive objects (`inattentional blindness'). Taken together, these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of `blindness'. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection, suggesting that observers attend to objects and events, not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment.},

  abstract = {We provide informal psychophysical support for a strategy where bottom--up features guide attention toward a target, and the top--down path interprets hypothetical shapes at the target location---as opposed to a dominant top--down approach. In our survey, for which we used the familiar picture of a Dalmatian dog against a dappled background, (i) 75\% of subjects initially found a bulging body which overlaps that of the dog, but final `top--down' percepts were unexpected: nearly all subjects assigned an incorrect head and limbs to the body; (ii) after random rotation of texture elements overlapping computed features only 45\% of subjects reported a bulging body, with a few adding limbs etc. The picture of the Dalmatian dog must therefore contain many bottom--up features---a top--down strategy may find `incorrect' targets at correct target locations. Computational support for these claims is more easily constructed than one may expect. We could compute at least two bottom--up features, both useful in 3-D surface interpolation from 2-D scenes, which yielded significant values at the location of the Dalmatian dog: anisotropic texture compression and affine texture distortion cues. We therefore conclude that the role of top--down processing is overstated in a traditional example such as the Dalmatian dog picture.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

You probably know one of these too.  But it's not our fault. And luckily, Roman Mars of 99\% Invisible magically arrived in my cellphone to send me on a cross-country journey to find out the incredible surprises behind this common complaint:  Don Norman started complaining about doors over 25 years ago. Doors shouldn't need instructions --~the shape of them can guide you through just fine.  So why do so many doors need instruction manuals right on the side of them?   When most people complain about something, nothing happens. Don Norman is not most people --~he's a psychologist and cognitive scientist.  Don Norman thought about, and wrote about his complaints so incredibly thoroughly that he changed the world.  99\% Invisible's Roman Mars helps tell the story.

  abstract = {3D object reconstruction from a single image is a highly under-determined problem, requiring strong prior knowledge of plausible 3D shapes. This introduces challenges for learning-based approaches, as 3D object annotations are scarce in real images. Previous work chose to train on synthetic data with ground truth 3D information, but suffered from domain adaptation when tested on real data. In this work, we propose MarrNet, an end-to-end trainable model that sequentially estimates 2.5D sketches and 3D object shape. Our disentangled, two-step formulation has three advantages. First, compared to full 3D shape, 2.5D sketches are much easier to be recovered from a 2D image; models that recover 2.5D sketches are also more likely to transfer from synthetic to real data. Second, for 3D reconstruction from 2.5D sketches, systems can learn purely from synthetic data. This is because we can easily render realistic 2.5D sketches without modeling object appearance variations in real images, including lighting, texture, etc. This further relieves the domain adaptation problem. Third, we derive differentiable projective functions from 3D shape to 2.5D sketches; the framework is therefore end-to-end trainable on real images, requiring no human annotations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape reconstruction.},
